# Translatable-models

Package installation does not affect original behaviour. You do not need to make any migrations for existing tables. 
All translated data are stored in the separate package's provided 'translations' table.

##### TODO
- Add possibility to ignore mutators & accessors for translations
- Add possibility to simple API storing 
- Add more API engine drivers
- Add possibility to use auto-translation on updated\created events
